# Beginner
If you are beginner in machine learning and probably wondering how to apply classification algorithms in R,this repo contains code for SVM,Logistic Regression and Random Forest models applied on Wilt Dataset.Accuracy of each model is mentioned in the code.
## Wilt Dataset
This data set contains some training and testing data from a remote sensing study by Johnson et al. (2013) that involved detecting diseased trees in Quickbird imagery. There are few training samples for the 'diseased trees' class (74) and many for 'other land cover' class (4265).\
The data set consists of image segments, generated by segmenting the pansharpened image. The segments contain spectral information from the Quickbird multispectral image bands and texture information from the panchromatic (Pan) image band. The testing data set is for the row with â€œSegmentation scale 15 segments and original multi-spectral image Spectral information in Table 2 of the reference (i.e. row 5)
## Attribute Information:
 - class: 'w' (diseased trees),'n' (all other land cover) 
 - GLCM_Pan: GLCM mean texture (Pan band) 
 - Mean_G: Mean green value 
 - Mean_R: Mean red value 
 - Mean_NIR: Mean NIR value 
 - SD_Pan: Standard deviation (Pan band)
